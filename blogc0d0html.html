                        <h2 style="color: #ad4d27;">1. Services Specialization</h2>
                        <img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://www.neubloc.com/nl/2004-1/it-services-product-dev.png" alt="" />
                        <p>Software development outsourcing is divided into two types of firms:</p>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Firms providing IT services</li>
                                <li>Firms specializing in product development</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Both firms function differently in terms of the duration the team collaborates for, the specification process, and the services provided.</p>

                        <p><strong>IT service firms:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Collaborate for a limited time</li>
                                <li>Rely on heavy, detailed specification, because many projects are developed under fixed bids</li>
                        </ul>

Cloud storage, a term dating back to the 60’s, refers to the ability of remotely storing data in secure servers, a process which gained popularity among startups due to its innovative and unique infrastructure. It appeals to new startups not just for its ability to store files, photos and other content digitally, but also due to its ability to share information in a universal location.</p>

Software design and development is tricky. When you look for a management firm that can help you outsource your design and development, you want one that offers turn-key solutions. While a lot of overseas companies offer effective and affordable management services, they lack the complexity and success record of US-based management firms. There is a distinct difference between a company that is based in the United States and a company that is not. Understanding those differences is important.
