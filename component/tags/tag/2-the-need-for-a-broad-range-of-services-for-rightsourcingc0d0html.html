			<description><![CDATA[<p>Designers usually are not the end-users of a given product, but most engineered products are marketed with little or no user input or involvement. Co-design is a design practice utilizing User Centered Design (UCD) that relies on user input to aid product design before marketing it.</p>
<p>This approach has several advantages:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Greater customer demand</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Improved user adoption</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Higher user satisfaction</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Increased product profitability
