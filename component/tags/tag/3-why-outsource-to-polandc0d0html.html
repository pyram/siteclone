<p>Jones Lang LaSalle, a famous professional services and investment management company specializing in real estate, recently reported that Poland is “the leading outsourcing destination in Europe.”1 Why is this? Because software development outsourcing to Poland offers several benefits:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Human capital: hardworking, highly educated and loyal employees</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Low attrition: drastically lower than India and China</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. IP protection: on par with Western norms</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Infrastructure: massive investment from the EU is boosting modern infrastructure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Cost: effective productivity competitive with India and China</p>
