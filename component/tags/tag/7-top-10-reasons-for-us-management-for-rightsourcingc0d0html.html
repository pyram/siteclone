                        <p>Software development outsourcing is divided into two types of firms:</p>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Firms providing IT services</li>
                                <li>Firms specializing in product development</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Both firms function differently in terms of the duration the team collaborates for, the specification process, and the services provided.</p>

                        <p><strong>IT service firms:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Collaborate for a limited time</li>
                                <li>Rely on heavy, detailed specification, because many projects are developed under fixed bids</li>
                        </ul>
